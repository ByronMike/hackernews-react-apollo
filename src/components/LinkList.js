This function allows you to define your GraphQL operation as a string literal within a template literal.

1) loading: Is true as long as the request is still ongoing and the response hasnâ€™t been received.
2) error: In case the request fails, this field will contain information about what exactly went wrong.
3) data: This is the actual data that was received from the server. It has the links property which represents a list of Link elements.*/
